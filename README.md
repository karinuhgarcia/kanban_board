# Full-Stack React: Kanban Board with JWT Authentication

## üìù Overview

This project is a secure, full-stack Kanban board application built with React, Express, Sequelize, and PostgreSQL. It features authentication using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**, allowing users to securely log in and manage their tasks. The server verifies login requests and protects API routes using token-based authentication, while the frontend stores tokens in `localStorage` to persist sessions and secure user access.

This was built to fulfill Challenge #14 of the Full-Stack Bootcamp curriculum.
